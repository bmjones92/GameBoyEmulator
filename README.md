# About the Emulator
This is a Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulator that I developed for my senior capstone project in college. I chose it
because it was uniquely challenging and gave me an opportunity to learn more about how hardware works. It is written
in Java and the frontend user interface is built with JavaFX.

Please note that the emulator is far from complete. Although most games will boot, there is a high probability that it
uses some functionality that is either not yet implemented or inaccurate. **I do not recommend using this emulator as
there are far better ones available**.
